# CloseConfirm

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that does stop you accidentally closing the game.

This stops the close button on the window as well as alt-f4 from closing the game but rather opening up the dash to the exit game screen.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [CloseConfirm.dll](https://github.com/AlexW-578/CloseConfirm/releases/latest/download/CloseConfirm.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
